# ml-project-2-stockdataholm
## Code Organisation

The code for this project is organized into the following folders:

- meteo_data: This directory contains the meteo_data used for the project requested from meteo swiss. This folder contains radiation_data.csv and temperature_data.csv.

- power_data: This directory contains the file Time_Value_CM.csv which is the power consumption of the CM building overall the year 2022.

- raw_data: This directory contains all the .mat files with the power consumption of all EPFL buildings overall the year 2022.

- code: This directory contains the notebook main.ipynb which is the source code for the project. There is also matlab_to_csv_Time_Value_CM.m, it is a MATLAB file which transforms the energy consumption data stored as .mat files from the raw_data folder to a csv file Time_Value_CM.csv used as input power data in main.ipynb.

- output: This directory contains any output generated by the code, such as plots, models, and output data. The model energy_forecasting_intraday.joblib and energy_forecasting_nextday.joblib are the two pre-trained model for intra day and next day energy forecasting. The data forecasting_intraday.csv and forecasting_nextday.csv contain the predictions of the test set using the intra-day and next-day models.
